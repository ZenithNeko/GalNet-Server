# The GalNet Server Repository!
### GalNet (short for Galaxy Net) is an open-source chatting/backend service made by I, my girlfriend, and a few of friends!

The server for GalNet which handles all of the input and output that makes GalNet work!

Input/output ranges from taking in websocket messages, images, and user profiles that make the client work!! Speaking of the client...

[Maybe check out the Repo for that... :3](https://github.com/ZenithNeko/GalNet-Client)

We are still working on the backend, as well as the frontend. So stick around if you'd like :3
